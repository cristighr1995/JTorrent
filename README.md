File Sharing Application
======
JTorrent is an open-source project. If you have any suggestions please don't hesitate to ask any question.

**Short description**

  The project must successfully share resource between users. This makes it necessary to establish a connection with the server and most importantly, each user has access to the Internet when he uses the application.
  When the user first launches JTorrent, he will need to create an account. Thus, register action is required for future customer authentication.
  Client Authentication does not require the password, as it will map the user's station with the name (username) that it has chosen at the time of registration.
  Before you can download, the upload action is required. This has to be done successfully and the server has a valid and updated list with all the files shared so far.
  In order to be able to choose a file of interest from that list, it is necessary that the server can distribute to those interested in the list that it owns. The search will be refined making navigating among files much easier.
When a user has a list of shared files, they will be able to download the files they want. Initially, it can only download a file, then download multiple files in parallel.
  The connection will be Peer 2 Peer.
